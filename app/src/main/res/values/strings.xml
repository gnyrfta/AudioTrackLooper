    <string name="info"><![CDATA[ \n\n<b>If you experience problems with audio crackle it is probably due to high load on your cpu.</b>
There are two solutions to this - either do not run as many applications in the background or lower the quality of the audio files from
44.1 Hz to something else using the button in the top panel. \n\nThis project is open source and released under
GPL v3. You can view the source code on <a href="https://github.com/gnyrfta/AudioTrackLooper"> Github</a>.
\n\nThe software is created by <a href=\"http://www.gnyrftacode.se\">David Jacobsson</a> and the audio tracks by
<a href="https://henrikjacobsson.com/">Henrik Jacobsson</a>.
The little star you can click for rating was created by open clip art creator \'Meticulous\'.\n\n
